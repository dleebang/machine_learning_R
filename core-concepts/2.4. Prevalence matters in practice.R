# A machine learning algorithm with very high sensitivity and specificity may not 
# be useful in practice when PREVALENCE IS CLOSE TO EITHER 0 or 1. For example,
# if you develop an algorithm for disease diagnosis with very high sensitivity, but
# the prevalence of the disease is pretty low, then the precision of your algorithm
# is probably very low based on Baye's theorem.
