Machine Learning with R

Machine Learning R scripts written for practice, exercises and assessments of two courses of HarvardX`s Data Sciente Professional Course: Linear Regression (https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-linear-regression) and Machine Learning (https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-machine-learning).

The linear regression section deals with the very foundations and assumptions of this statistical method for prediction and correlation analysis, while working with real cases such as Moneyball. 

The other machine learning sections are focused on core concepts such as nomenclature, evaluation metrics (for regression: mean squared error, r-squared; for classification: sensitivity and specificity, overall accuracy, F-means and ROC curve) and the bias-variance tradeoff. 

In advanced topics, the R scripts are written to build models using mainly the titanic dataset to test several different algorithms (supervised: logistic regression, generalized linear models, k-neares neighbors, classification and regression trees, and random forests) to make predictions with actual data.

The final sections deal with unsupervised machine learning such as matrix factorization, PCA, hierarchical clustering, and K-means.
