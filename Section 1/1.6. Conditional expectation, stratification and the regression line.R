# Correlation is not always a good summary of the relationship btw two
# variables
# 
# The general idea of conditional expectation is that we stratify a population
# into groups and compute summaries in each group
# 
# A practical way to improve the estimates of the conditional expectations 
# is to define strata rounding similar values of x
# 
# If there is perfect correlation, the regression line predicts an increase
# that is the same number of SDs for both variables. If there is 0 correlation,
# then we don't use x at all for the prediction and simply predict the average
# mu_y. For values btw 0 and 1, the prediction is somwhere in between. If
# the correlation is negative, we predict a reduction instead of an increase.
